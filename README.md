# Camagru

Camagru is a web-branch project from Ecole42 curriculum. Project was written from scratch and completed in roughly 3 weeks.  
Implemented using **PHP** on a server side, as well as **Vanilla JavaScript**, **Html** and **Css** with some **Bootstrap** components on a fron-end.  
As a bonus I've Ajaxified couple of sections (**Fetch** was used for 'Like' and 'Remove post' actions).



This application serves as a photo-gallery where user can:
* upload pictures from filesystem or by using his web-camera
* apply stickers to their pictures
* leave likes and comments to other users posts
* handle their profile setting such as:

    * change email, username, password
    * subscribe/unsubscribe from email notifications
    * remove account  
      
User will recieve an email notification when his post was commented.
